# HACKATHONNNN

This is a repository containing a game program formatted to run using Unity.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this program is to help kids who have a particular learning disability or neurological disorder.

## Learning Disabilities and Autism

The learning disability we are targeting is dyslexia (difficulty reading), but could also be used to target dycalculia (difficulty with math), and 
dysgraphia (difficulty with writing). All of these are can highly impact a young student's life and stick with them for years. The CDC states that these three learning disabilities are often paired with emotional and behavioral disorders that make it even harder to do well in school. A young student can have a hard time understanding why they are falling behind their peers and this can develop frustration or discourage them from academic related activities.

Autism is a neurological disorder that can affect several children; however, this is not something that can be easily diagnosed since this disorder is registered on a spectrum. For young autistic children, there are a few different symptoms of autism that can affect their learning and/or impact their ability to socialize. Since it is a disorder that has a spectrum, there are children who lack the ability to communicate verbally or interact appropriately in social settings, as well as children who are able to hyperfocus and learn a single subject of intrest in extreme depth and detail.

## Benefits

These disorders and disabilities can be stressful for a young, and still learning, child who seems to be falling behind in their school. At a very young age, this can be difficult for young parents and the student to process why they are struggling. With the aid of a game program, they can benefit from stimulus that they may not receive in a classroom setting. The game like format will help them process learning and cognitive skills that will improve their critical thinking skills, reading skills, and writing skills in a new and fun way. This format can also help improve motor skills, as players will have to control and time character movements in anticipation of interacting with the right answer in the game. Of course, we can't forget the benefit of relaxation. Games are known to be a relaxing pastime for many, and games can relieve tension in young children by providing something both fun and educational for them, rather than something that feels like homework.

>Some of these benefits are not strictly applicable to the version of the game currently available. Those who wish to alter the game to fit a different disorder or disability can do so quite easily while still retaining the basic principles of the game.

## Game Play

The current version is meant for kids of lower elementary age, who are suspected or already diagnosed with a disorder or disability that hinders their ability to learn. They can play with parental or teacher guidance to ensure that they are understanding or attempting to play the game.

### Play

The start screen will consist of the player character, depicted by a lion, which is restricted to horizontal movement using the **A** and **D** keys or the **<** and **>** keys. This character is able to move in the start screen but is not interacting with any objects yet. The game will not begin until the **Spacebar** is pressed.

### Pause

The game can be paused by pressing the **Spacebar**. When this occurs the player is not able to see the question.

### Game Play

When the game play starts, the first question will surface with a image that will depict a shape with a color. From the top of the screen will enter three pieces of meat for the lion to "eat." On each piece of meat there will be a shape that will match the color or shape of the image in the question as prompted. The player will place the lion under the piece of meat that matches and will wait for the lion to "catch" the meat to see if their answer is correct or not.

>The game can be modified to include letters for dyslexic children or numbers for those with dyscalculia. This game can also be increased in difficulty with other matching solutions such as facial features to display emotions for children who find it difficult to understand social and facial cues.

### Losing Lives

If the player fails to answer, or choses the wrong piece of meat to "catch," then they will lose a life. The player is given five lives at the beginning of the game.

### Game Over

If they run out of lives, the game will end and they will have lost. If they don't lose all their lives, they were successful in passing.
